# Overview

This is an example Splunk App that demonstrates how to use a setup page to check for the installation of app dependencies. This example adheres to Splunk Application Certification standards.

This app requires that users configure the weather app as a dependency in order to complete the setup process. The setup page checks whether the dependent app is configured and updated to a specific version before allowing users to access the app home page.

# Setup Page Entry Point

Splunk will automatically try to redirect the user to the setup page if the `app.conf`'s `[install]` stanza has its `is_configured` property set to false.

# Program Flow

This program starts in the `app.conf`, where the `[install]` stanza's `is_configured` property is set to `false`. This causes Splunk to redirect to it's setup page that is specified so that an admin/user can configure it for use.

In the `app.conf`'s, `[ui]` stanza there is a `setup_page` property that points to which resource should be used for the setup page. In this case it's pointing to `default/data/ui/views/setup_page_dashboard.xml`.

The dashboard view specifies its CSS and JavaScript resources and points to `appserver/static/javascript/setup_page.js`.

And finally the `setup_page.js` imports a React app from `appserver/static/javascript/views/app.js`.

There are two apps installed out-of-the-box when you `make` examples repo. Both not configured to begin with. Follow these steps to run through the dependency_checking_setup_page_app example:
- First navigate to the dependency_checking_app and attempt to configure. 
- There will be an alert that the `Weather_app_example` is not configured.
- Navigate to the `weather_app_example` and finish set up configuration. Ensure the version installed is greater or equal to 1.0.
- Navigate back to the dependency_checking_app and attempt to configure. 
- Set up configuration should complete successfully.
