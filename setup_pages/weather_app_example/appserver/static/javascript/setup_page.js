// This is an undocumented Splunk solution for how to include javascript logic
// from other files.
// Declare a require.config() and proviade a dictionary that has a `paths` keys.
// In the `paths` key provide another dictionary that declares custom classes.
// Each key should be the class name, and the value the path to the javascript file
// ../app/<extracted_folder_name_of_app>/<path to javascript file>(no extension)
// Then include those in the require method's array, and function.

// Common gotchas:
// 1) The path to the script autmatically appends .js, so don't include it
// 2) This only provides supprt for JavaScript files, plain-text html files won't work
// 3) The "../app" is required as a prefix and your app name is required to follow it
// 4) After the app name, the path is provided as though it were from the
//    $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/appserver/static/* directory

require.config({
    paths: {
        // $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SPLUNK_APP_NAME/appserver/static/javascript/views/setup_page_example
        myApp: "../app/" + app_name + "/javascript/views/app",
        // React v16.13.1
        react: "../app/" + app_name + "/javascript/vendor/react.production.min",
        ReactDOM: "../app/" + app_name + "/javascript/vendor/react-dom.production.min",
    },
    scriptType: "module",
});

require([
    // Splunk Web Framework Provided files
    // Custom files
    "react", // this needs to be lowercase because ReactDOM refers to it as lowercase
    "ReactDOM",
    "myApp",
], function(react, ReactDOM, myApp) {
    ReactDOM.render(myApp, document.getElementById('main_container'));
});
